Use the following command to compile:

$ g++ avl.cpp
Use the following command to test:

./a.out input1.txt

This works due to a very specific flow.
Insert nodes,
automatically check if tree is balanced by calculating differences in subtree heights
balance based on specific balance integers
print

Deleting is similar
Delete flow is based off of the specific node to be deleted
Root is the most complex
Set new node as temp variable
Set temp equal to root
Delete original temp node
Balance as mentioned above.
